atrium_rocrate.py — the RO-Crate view of an ATRIUM document record, and the run's CreateAction.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
======================
``atrium_document.py`` produces a per-document record that ``docs/document_schema.md`` calls
"one FAIR, versioned JSON for search and catalogue export". The DMP's WP3 standards column names
**RO-Crate** (ufal/atrium-project#54), and the AMČR pilot stores every archived record as an
RO-Crate with one Process Run Crate ``CreateAction`` per run (atrium-project#71; grounding report
of 2026-09-30, items 1-3). Everything such a crate needs, ATRIUM already records:

    source            -> the original input, by doc_id + sha256/sha512 (archive-managed, never a path)
    derived_from      -> the persistent step outputs = the crate's data entities
    regenerable       -> recipes for files that DO NOT EXIST = never data entities
    provenance        -> the accreted licence union + one entry per contributing run
    assembled.blocks  -> per-block stamps = the granularity a CreateAction chain needs
    atrium_paradata   -> tool_version / repository / docker_image / run_uuid / times per run
    atrium_vocab      -> resolvable URIs for every controlled term the record carries

So this module maps rather than invents. Where a field does not exist it is **omitted**, not
guessed: a crate that quietly asserts a checksum nobody computed is worse than one that admits the
gap.

WHAT IT PRODUCES
================
* ``document_crate(record)`` — the crate of one record: RO-Crate 1.2, Process Run Crate 0.5.
  With ``fragment=True`` the same entities WITHOUT the metadata descriptor and the root, for
  embedding in a crate someone else owns (AMČR's record crate, aiscr-webamcr#4316).
* ``run_crate(records)`` — one pipeline run over several records, referencing their crates.
* ``create_action(paradata)`` — one run as a nested JSON-LD ``CreateAction``: what every service
  returns as ``paradata`` and what AMČR stores as the run's paradata file.
* ``wrap_fragment(fragment)`` — a fragment under a stub root, which is how a fragment is validated.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT
=======================
* **Not a publisher.** It builds a metadata graph and can write it next to a directory of
  outputs. Nothing is uploaded, registered, or minted.
* **Not a second provenance model.** ``atrium_paradata.py`` stays the record of how a run
  behaved; this is a *view* over what is already recorded, built after the fact.
* **Not a writer of document records.** It never mutates one.

DEPENDENCIES
============
Standard library only. An RDF library is deliberately **not** introduced, for the same reason
``atrium_vocab.py`` refuses one: the serialisation here is small, closed and fully determined by
its input, and the output is drift-gated by byte comparison. The conformance check is the
RO-Crate validator, run in the hub's CI (``tools/ci/rocrate_check.py``), never a dependency here.

``atrium_vocab`` is imported softly — with it, every controlled term in the record becomes a
``DefinedTerm`` with a resolvable ``https://w3id.org/atrium/`` URI; without it the crate is still
valid, just less semantic.

DETERMINISM
===========
Two calls on the same record produce byte-identical JSON. ``@graph`` is sorted by ``@id`` (with
the descriptor and the root pinned first) and ``json.dumps`` runs with ``sort_keys=True``.
``datePublished`` is derived from the record's own newest block stamp, never from the clock, and a
run's identifier is the ``run_uuid`` the record carries — nothing is minted here.

#: RO-Crate specification this module targets. The three strings move together, and moving them
#: is a deliberate act: `conformsTo` is what a consumer reads to decide how to interpret the
#: graph, so a bump is a compatibility statement about the crates already written, exactly like
#: SCHEMA_VERSION in atrium_document.py. 1.2 is the version agreed with AMČR (atrium-project#71):

#: with atrium_vocab.SKOS_BASE, which is the one place an ATRIUM URI is rooted.
ATRIUM_BASE = getattr(atrium_vocab, "SKOS_BASE", "https://w3id.org/atrium/")

#: The ATRIUM tool authors, identical in every tool repo's CITATION.cff. Since atrium-project#71
#: they are each tool's `creator` — the people who made the software — and no longer the crate
#: root's `author`: the record is the archive's, the tools are theirs. ORCIDs are the `@id`s, the
#: RO-Crate convention, so no ATRIUM identifier is minted for a person.

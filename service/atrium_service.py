"""atrium_service.py — shared FastAPI meta-contract helpers for ATRIUM services.

Canonical copy lives in the hub at ``docs/templates/shared/atrium_service.py`` and is
mirrored **byte-identically** into every tool repo's ``service/`` directory (enforced by
``para-drift.reusable.yml``, the same mechanism that guards ``atrium_paradata.py``).

It implements the normative §4 meta-contract of ``docs/agent_skill_strategy.md`` so every
service reports an identical shape and agents/clients can rely on it:

* ``read_tool_version`` — version from ``para_config.txt`` ``[tool]`` (single source of truth).
* ``build_info``        — the §4.1 ``/info`` envelope (``service``/``version``/``endpoints``/``limits``).
* ``attach_health``     — the §4.1 ``GET /health`` endpoint (shallow + ``?deep=true``), and,
  when given a ``ServiceState``, the §4.6 ``GET /ready`` readiness endpoint (issue #55).
* ``resolve_max_upload_mb`` / ``add_cors`` — the §4.5 upload-limit and CORS conventions.
* ``attach_error_handlers`` / ``error_body`` / ``AtriumHTTPError`` / ``busy`` — the §4.4
  harmonised error body ``{status, reason, detail}`` with its registered ``reason`` codes
  (atrium-project#32 item 2, landed with #53). Every error a service returns has this
  shape; ``reason`` is ``null`` until a code is registered for its cause.
* ``build_info`` given a ``LimitSet`` and ``read_upload_bounded`` / ``check_body_size`` —
  the §4.5 limits contract (atrium-project#53, factor III): every limit is a setting,
  reported in ``/info`` with the variable that sets it, and an input over one is refused
  with ``reason: "limit_exceeded"``. The limits themselves are declared with the
  framework-free ``atrium_limits.py`` at the repo root, which library code and the CLIs
  import directly; that module is imported lazily here, inside the functions that need
  it, because a service may import this module before its repo root is on ``sys.path``.
* ``ServiceState`` / ``attach_inflight_middleware`` / ``serve_lifecycle`` — the §4.6
  disposability contract (issue #55): readiness that flips on ``SIGTERM``, and a drain that
  waits for in-flight requests and explicitly tracked background work before the process
  exits, so a rolling restart does not kill work already in progress.
* The typed contract (§4.8; atrium-project#32 round 2, items 1 and 3): the pydantic models
  every service's responses are declared with (``ErrorBody``, ``InfoBase``, ``LimitNote``,
  ``HealthBody``, ``ReadyBody``, ``CreateAction``, ``AtriumDocument``); ``error_responses``
  and ``operation_id``, which every ``FastAPI(...)`` passes so each route documents the
  error body and keeps a stable operationId; ``attach_openapi_contract``, which finishes the
  generated spec (the reason-code registry, the record schema, the service id); and
  ``openapi_digest``, the sha256 ``/info`` reports so a deployed image can be checked
  against the ``openapi.json`` attached to its release. The spec is committed as
  ``service/openapi.json`` and released by the stdlib-only ``atrium_openapi.py`` at the repo
  root, which this module imports lazily, like ``atrium_limits``.
* ``parse_record_part`` — opens the document record a request carries and refuses one that
  cannot be opened with ``reason: "invalid_record"``; a record that opens but fails the
  schema is left to the tool, which reports it as ``document_json_schema_error``.

The module deliberately imports only FastAPI/Starlette, pydantic (FastAPI's own model layer,
declared and pinned in every ``service/requirements.txt``, because the committed spec is a
function of both versions) and the standard library, so it stays inside the no-model fast
lane.

# The typed contract (§4.8; atrium-project#32 round 2, items 1 and 3)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# These models DOCUMENT the responses; they do not filter them. Every route declares
# `response_model=None, responses={200: {"model": ...}}`, so the bytes a service sends are
# exactly what its handler builds, and the per-repo contract tests validate real responses
# against the PUBLISHED schema (atrium_openapi.validate_response). Their docstrings and
# field descriptions are published in every spec, so they are written for the client.
#
# Rules, from the 2026-09-28 design review (agent_dev_logs/plans/32.plan.md):
#   * a field the handler always emits has NO default, so it is required (nullable where it
#     can be null): oasdiff rates removing a required response property as a breaking change,
#     an optional one only after atrium_openapi.py raises that rule;
#   * no enums in responses: a value is an open string whose known values are in its
#     description, so a new value never breaks a client generated from an older spec;
#   * every model allows extra members, so a later additive field is not a breaking change.

    """Async context manager an existing FastAPI ``lifespan`` wraps its body in (issue #55).

    Every ATRIUM service already has a ``lifespan`` that does warmup; this composes with
    it rather than replacing it::

        @asynccontextmanager
        async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
            warm_up_models()          # existing startup work, unchanged

                                        # the drain below completes

    **On entry**, installs a handler for ``SIGTERM``/``SIGINT`` that sets
    ``state.draining = True`` and then calls whatever handler was previously registered
    for that signal. uvicorn installs its own handler (``Server.handle_exit``, via
    ``Server.capture_signals()``) in ``Server.serve()`` *before* it runs app startup —
    and this call happens during app startup — so the "previous" handler this captures
    is always uvicorn's own, and calling it is what keeps uvicorn's graceful shutdown
    (draining in-flight HTTP connections, then resuming this generator past its
    ``yield``) working. Installing a handler that replaces rather than chains to the
    previous one breaks shutdown outright — this was verified empirically against a
    real uvicorn 0.52 subprocess sent a real ``SIGTERM`` (issue #55): the process still
    exits with the signal's own code (128 + 15 = 143, since uvicorn's
    ``capture_signals()`` re-raises the captured signal after a graceful exit, so that a
    supervisor sees the same exit status a process that did not catch the signal at all
    would show), not 0 — a container that handles ``SIGTERM`` gracefully is still
    expected to report having been terminated by it, not to fake a code-0 exit.

    **On exit** (once the wrapped ``yield`` resumes — i.e. once uvicorn's own drain of
    in-flight HTTP connections has already finished or hit its own
    ``--timeout-graceful-shutdown``): additionally waits up to ``drain_timeout`` seconds
    for ``state.in_flight`` and every task registered via :meth:`ServiceState.track` to
    reach zero, so work that outlives its originating request (a job queue, a
    ``BackgroundTask``-style cleanup) is not orphaned when the process exits. Callers
    should keep ``drain_timeout`` comfortably below the container's
    ``terminationGracePeriodSeconds`` (Kubernetes) so this wait itself does not run past
    the point a ``SIGKILL`` arrives anyway. A service with no tracked work returns
    immediately here — this is a no-op, not an added delay.

    Only installs signal handlers when called from the main thread (mirrors uvicorn's
    own guard in ``capture_signals()``), so this is also safe to call from a worker
    thread or under ``TestClient`` — it becomes a no-op wrapper in that case.

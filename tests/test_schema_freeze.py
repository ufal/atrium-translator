"""The schema freeze, checked in every repository: this copy of the schema against `doc-schema-v1`.

WHY THIS EXISTS. atrium-project#54 froze `atrium_document.schema.json` at 1.0 and cut the tag
`doc-schema-v1` for it, separate from the moving `v1` tag the tool repos vendor from. A tag on its
own checks nothing. The canonical file kept changing after it, which is allowed for an additive
change (versioning rule 1; the first one was llm-enrich#18's `lines[].style.region`), but nothing
said which changes those were, and no repository could show that the schema it carries still
honours the frozen one. "Frozen" was a claim in a changelog.

This file is vendored with the schema (hub: docs/templates/shared/; tool repos: tests/, with the
schema and its frozen copy at the repo root), so every repository checks its OWN copy:

  * the frozen copy `atrium_document.schema.doc-schema-v1.json` is byte-for-byte the file the tag
    names -- pinned by git blob id, the id `git rev-parse doc-schema-v1:<path>` prints, so it
    needs no git and no tags;
  * nothing declared at the freeze was removed or renamed (versioning rule 2 -- that is a MAJOR);
  * every constraining difference since the freeze is in `POST_FREEZE_CHANGES`, pinned to the node
    it adds. Descriptions, `$comment`s and examples are free.

Read it as the answer to "may I change the schema?". An additive change -- a new optional field or
block, or a narrowing that still admits every shape in the hub's tests/test_document_required.py --
takes no new tag and no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump: register it here, write its
`## Changelog — <date>` in the hub's docs/document_schema.md, add its producer shapes, then
re-vendor (scripts/revendor_shared.sh) and move `v1`. Removing or renaming a declared property is a
`2.0`, with its own tag `doc-schema-v2`, frozen copy and `FREEZES[2]` entry. The procedure is in
docs/document_schema.md, "Freeze & conformance".

What needs the hub -- the tag itself, the changelog sections, and validating every producer's
record shape under both schemas (jsonschema) -- is the hub's tests/test_schema_freeze_records.py.

The imports below are plain top-level imports, as in test_document_originators.py: pytest puts
this file's directory on sys.path in the hub, and pytest.ini's `pythonpath = .` does it in a tool
repo.

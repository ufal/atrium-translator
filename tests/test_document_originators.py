tests/test_document_originators.py

Issue #18 §1a — block ownership for digital-born documents.

Four blocks (`pages`, `content`, `lines`, `tables`) describe a document's POSITIONAL
PLANE, and there are two ways to acquire one: OCR/ALTO, or direct extraction from a
digital-born PDF/DOCX. They are mutually exclusive per document, so `BLOCK_OWNERS` lists
both possible originators and `source.origin` picks between them per record.

These tests pin three things that were each a live defect before this landed:

  1. `digital-convert` can actually originate the positional blocks (it could not — every
     path either raised or silently ate the payload).
  2. The two originators cannot be mixed on one document, and `merge_block()` is checked
     as well as `set_block()` (it bypassed `_assert_owner()` entirely, so `pages` and
     `lines` were never ownership-checked at all).
  3. `lines[]` rows survive the round trip with their `text` and `bbox` intact. The
     earlier `BLOCK_FIELD_OWNERS` draft granted the converter only `["group_id"]`, which
     `merge_block()` honours SILENTLY — `text` was filtered out with no warning and the
     record still validated, because `lines[]` requires only `page`+`line`.

Style follows tests/test_document_record.py (one rule per test, named in the docstring),
but uses the public `logger.run_id` rather than `logger._run_id` — the #13 hardening pass
added it precisely so tests stop reaching into privates.

(That reference used to read `tests/test_atrium_document.py`, which does not exist in this
repo. Worth more than a pointer fix: plan §1b deferred the `merge_block()` dropped-field
warning on the grounds that "at least one existing call site passes context fields it
doesn't own for readability (tests/test_atrium_document.py has the translator merging
entities with surface)". No such call site exists here — the only translator usage is
`set_block("translations", ...)` — so the stated cost of that fix was unverified. It is now
available opt-in via `warn_dropped_fields=True` and `assert_fields_survived()`, which needs
no call-site cleanup at all.)

Canonical copy (issue #10, finding D9)
--------------------------------------
This file is **hub-canonical**. It lives in atrium-project as
`docs/templates/shared/test_document_originators.py`, beside the canonical
`atrium_document.py` + `atrium_document.schema.json` it exercises, and is vendored into
every tool repo at `tests/test_document_originators.py` — exactly the arrangement
`test_para_licenses.py` uses. `para-drift.reusable.yml` `diff -u`s all six copies, so edit
the hub copy and re-vendor with `scripts/revendor_shared.sh`; never edit a vendored one.

It was promoted out of atrium-llm-enrich, which held the only copy. The hub cited this
path as what "pins" the §1a contract (`docs/document_schema.md`, `atrium_document.py`'s
`BLOCK_FIELD_OWNERS` comment) while containing no such file, and the other four repos had
no origin coverage at all — so a regression in `_assert_origin_consistent()` passed Hub
Self-Check cleanly and propagated to five repos the moment `v1` moved.

The imports below are deliberately plain top-level imports, and must stay that way: pytest
puts the test file's own directory on `sys.path`, which resolves
`atrium_document`/`atrium_paradata` both from here in `docs/templates/shared/` and once
vendored into a tool repo (where the repo root is importable via `pytest.ini`'s
`pythonpath = .` or `tests/__init__.py`). Any path arithmetic added here would resolve in
one layout and not the other.

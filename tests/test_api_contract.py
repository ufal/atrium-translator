"""tests/test_api_contract.py — ATRIUM API meta-contract conformance (strategy §4, issue #32).

Hermetic contract test: asserts the ``/info`` envelope, ``/health``, ``/ready`` (issue #55), the advertised endpoint
set, and OpenAPI validity against the in-process app. ``importorskip``-guarded and tolerant of
missing service dependencies, so it is a clean no-op in the fast lane and a real check in CI.

"""
atrium_document.py  –  Per-document aggregate record ("paradata pair") for ATRIUM pipelines.

Sibling of `atrium_paradata.py`. Where paradata answers *how a run behaved*, this answers
*what we know about one document*: its text, pages, tables, forms, entities and enrichment,
gathered across the pipeline into one FAIR, versioned JSON.

The tools are separate containers and never see each other's outputs, so the record is built
by **accretion**: every tool takes the previous version of the JSON (if it is given one) and
returns it with **only its own block** updated. Nothing else is touched.

    doc.json ──► [tool A] ──► doc.json ──► [tool B] ──► doc.json ──► …
                  writes A's block only     writes B's block only

Contract (see docs/document_schema.md):
  1. Optional baseline in, updated record out. `doc_id` travels WITH the baseline: the
     originator derives it once with `canonical_doc_id()`, every stage after it inherits.
  2. A tool writes its own block(s) only; every other block is passed through untouched.
  3. No baseline given → the tool emits just its own part (standalone-safe), and that is the
     only case in which a later tool's own `canonical_doc_id()` decides the key.
  4. Each block is stamped with the writing tool's program / run_id / paradata_ref.
  5. Licenses accrete through `para_licenses.merge_effective_licenses` (most restrictive wins).
  6. Unknown or newer blocks are preserved; a newer major schema is refused.

Only ever reference **persistent** artifacts: the original input, or a previous step's stored
output. Transient derivatives (page images/thumbnails, the annotated Markdown) belong in
`regenerable` as a recipe, never as a stored path.

Four blocks — `pages`, `content`, `lines`, `tables` — are the document's *positional plane*,
and since Issue #18 they have two possible **originators**: `alto-postprocess` for an OCR/ALTO
document, `digital-convert` for a digital-born PDF/DOCX. Which one applies is fixed per record
by `source.origin` (see `ORIGIN_ORIGINATORS` / `resolve_originator()`). Calling `set_source()`
first is the natural order, but it is **no longer required**: a block written before the origin
is known is re-checked as soon as one arrives, and again in `to_dict()`.

Two things the JSON Schema deliberately cannot check, and where they live instead:

  * a field-ownership drop — `lines[]` requires only `page`+`line`, so a row stripped of its
    `text` by `merge_block()` is a *valid* row. Use `assert_fields_survived()` (or
    `dropped_fields()`) right after a merge; `warn_dropped_fields=True` turns it on globally.
  * the schema itself being reachable — `schema_path()` / `load_schema()` /
    `validate_document()` resolve it next to whichever copy of this module was vendored.

#:
#: RESOLVED (Issue #18 §1a, 2026-08-03): a TUPLE value means the block has more than
#: one possible ORIGINATOR and the choice is fixed per DOCUMENT, not per ecosystem.
#: An ALTO/OCR document's positional plane (pages/content/lines/tables) comes from
#: alto-postprocess; a digital-born PDF/DOCX's comes from digital-convert; and no
#: document is ever both. Which one applies is decided by `source.origin` — already
#: first-writer-wins in set_source() — via ORIGIN_ORIGINATORS below, and checked by
#: _assert_origin_consistent().
#:
#: The two rejected alternatives, recorded so this is not relitigated:
#:   1. Give alto-postprocess a "no-op passthrough" mode so it stays owner of record.
#:      Rejected: it stamps assembled.blocks[<block>].program = "alto-postprocess"
#:      and appends a provenance.contributors[] entry with a paradata_ref, for a run
#:      that did nothing, in a record whose purpose is FAIR catalogue export. Rule 4
#:      exists for attribution granularity; this would falsify it. It also puts the
#:      alto container back on the digital-born critical path, which the whole
#:      four-layer converter design exists to avoid.
#:   2. Simply add a second name here with no further guard. Rejected: `content` and
#:      `tables` are NOT field-split, so either originator could set_block() straight
#:      over the other's. The mutual exclusivity that makes two originators safe would
#:      be an unwritten assumption instead of a check.
#:
#: This table authorises WRITES only. The read-time answer to "who wrote this block in
#: THIS record" is, as it always was, assembled.blocks[<block>].program. Any consumer
#: hardcoding a program name off this table was already reading the wrong contract —
#: see the ownership section of docs/document_schema.md.
#:
#: `forms` has no such conflict — it is always llm-enrich (VLM/LLM-driven field
#: extraction), regardless of whether the document is scanned or digital-born, so it
#: is a plain single-owner block from day one.

        other four stages all said ``CTX000000003``.

        The caller's value is a GUESS FROM A LOCAL FILENAME, and the pipeline routinely feeds a
        stage something other than the original: the translator's real input is
        ``PAGE_ALTO/<doc>/<doc>-1.alto.xml``, a page alto-postprocess split out, so
        ``canonical_doc_id()`` correctly answers ``<doc>-1`` — correct for that FILE, wrong for
        the RECORD. No filename heuristic can close that gap in general (a document may legally
        be named ``sbn.2019-1``); the baseline can, because it carries the answer explicitly.
        So the rule is not "derive it more cleverly" but "do not re-derive what you were told":
        the originator names the document, every later stage inherits that name, and
        ``canonical_doc_id()`` decides only for a run that has no baseline at all (rule 3).

        The divergence is still worth saying out loud — it usually means a tool's own naming
        disagrees with the pipeline's — but it is not an error and never fatal: the record that
        comes out is the correct one, and raising here (even under ``strict``) would stall a
        pipeline over an id this method has just repaired. Compare
        ``merge_document_records()``, which DOES raise on differing doc_ids: there the ids
        arrive from two independent records and disagreement means two documents, while here
        there is one record and one of the two names for it is authoritative.

    and resolves per block using `assembled.blocks[*].updated_at`: newest contribution wins.

      the first record's `sha256` and able to swap the origin out from under an
      already-written plane. Now the first non-empty value wins per sub-key, and a
      contradiction between two inputs is reported rather than resolved by argument order.
    * **`derived_from`** and **`regenerable`** are append-only maps whose whole purpose is to
      accumulate one entry per stage. Replacing them wholesale threw away every entry the
      losing branch had added — real provenance loss on exactly the fan-in this function
      exists for. They are merged key-wise instead, first writer winning per key.

    A fan-in is also a third write path that bypassed the §1a check entirely, so the merged
    positional plane is verified against the merged `source.origin` at the end.
